# **Economy & Progression Balancing (EPB) - ZoneCommander**

## **1. Introduction**
### **Purpose**
This document defines the economy, resource management, and progression balancing for ZoneCommander. It ensures fair and engaging gameplay by structuring resource flow, faction economies, trading systems, and player progression mechanics.

### **Scope**
- **Faction-based economies** with unique trading rules.
- **Resource availability & scarcity mechanics**.
- **Progression scaling & faction development**.
- **Impact of world events on economy**.

## **2. Economic Model**

### **2.1 Resource Types**
- **Currency:** Universal in-game credits used for trading and upgrades.
- **Weapons & Ammunition:** Acquired through trading, looting, or crafting.
- **Medical Supplies:** Essential for squad sustainability, obtained via faction support or scavenging.
- **Artifacts:** Special anomalies that provide unique benefits and are highly valued in trade.
- **Supply Materials:** Used for constructing outposts, upgrading equipment, and maintaining logistics.

### **2.2 Trading & Bartering**
- **Faction-Specific Trade Rules:** Some factions restrict trade to allies (e.g., Duty only trades artifacts with Ecologists).
- **Dynamic Prices:** Prices fluctuate based on availability, recent conflicts, and supply chain disruptions.
- **Black Market:** A neutral trading hub with **higher prices** but unrestricted item access.

## **3. Progression & Scaling**

### **3.1 Faction Progression**
- **Reputation System:** Determines AI faction interactions with the player.
- **Faction Growth Mechanics:**
  - **Recruitment Rate:** Adjusted based on faction influence and war attrition.
  - **Technology Upgrades:** Unlocks better equipment and tactics over time.
  - **Expansion Thresholds:** New territories provide more resources but increase enemy aggression.

### **3.2 Player Progression**
- **Experience System:** Players earn XP for victories, trades, and exploration.
- **Leadership Rank:** Higher ranks grant access to new squad types and global faction decisions.
- **Perks & Special Abilities:** Unique passive bonuses based on leadership style (e.g., Diplomatic bonuses vs. Military efficiency).

## **4. Economy & World Events**

### **4.1 Impact of Zone Events on Economy**
- **Blowouts & PSI Emissions:** Destroy stockpiles and reset artifact placements.
- **Mutant Migrations:** Cause supply route disruptions.
- **Zombie Raids:** Decrease faction population, forcing increased recruitment efforts.
- **Trade Route Blockades:** Occur if a faction gains too much control over supply chains.

### **4.2 Economic Crises & Shortages**
- **High demand → Prices increase.**
- **Low supply → Rationing required.**
- **Faction-controlled territories directly affect trade availability.**
- **Black market thrives when shortages are widespread.**

## **5. Balancing Considerations**

### **5.1 Inflation & Deflation Mechanics**
- **Inflation prevention:**
  - Cap on max currency per faction.
  - Prices adjust dynamically based on faction spending.
- **Deflation risks:**
  - If too many factions hoard resources, the market stagnates.
  - Periodic crises encourage spending and engagement.

### **5.2 Resource Redistribution for Fair Play**
- **Losing factions receive resource boosts** to maintain competition.
- **Winning factions face increased upkeep costs** to prevent snowballing.
- **Neutral factions may intervene to rebalance power** in extreme cases.

---

## **6. Future Considerations**
- **Refinement of AI trade behavior** for realistic economic shifts.
- **Player-driven economy mechanics** (faction-controlled stock markets, investment options).
- **Special missions that impact economy** (stealing resources, sabotaging supply lines).
- **Dynamic scarcity system** for increased realism and difficulty scaling.
