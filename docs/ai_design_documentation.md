# **AI Behavior Specification (AIB) - ZoneCommander**

## **1. Introduction**
### **Purpose**
This document defines the AI behaviors for various entities in ZoneCommander. It details the decision-making processes, hierarchy, and interaction models for AI-driven factions, generals, squads, and individual units.

### **Scope**
- **AI Levels:** Faction leaders, generals, squad leaders, and squad members.
- **Decision-making frameworks:** State machines, behavior trees, and rule-based systems.
- **AI interaction with game systems:** Diplomacy, combat, economy, and resource management.

## **2. AI Hierarchy & Responsibilities**

### **2.1 Faction Leader AI**
- Oversees overall faction strategies, including diplomacy, economy, and military expansion.
- Assigns generals to specific regions or strategic objectives.
- Evaluates alliances and hostilities based on resource availability and past interactions.
- Responds to global events (mutant migrations, anomalies, faction wars).

### **2.2 General AI**
- Interprets high-level objectives from the Faction Leader AI.
- Deploys squads based on tactical importance and available intelligence.
- Allocates reinforcements and logistical support to squads in need.
- Adjusts strategy dynamically based on enemy troop movements and battlefield conditions.

### **2.3 Squad Leader AI**
- Executes missions and tactical maneuvers assigned by Generals.
- Issues orders to squad members (e.g., attack, defend, flank, retreat).
- Adjusts positioning based on terrain and enemy positions.
- Calls for reinforcements or supply drops when needed.

### **2.4 Squad Member AI**
- Follows orders from Squad Leader AI.
- Executes individual combat behaviors (taking cover, reloading, using grenades, etc.).
- Evaluates threats and prioritizes targets dynamically.
- Responds to environmental factors such as anomalies, radiation, and weather changes.

## **3. AI Decision-Making Models**

### **3.1 Faction Leader Decision Tree**
- **Evaluate resources:** Determine if expansion or consolidation is needed.
- **Assess diplomatic status:** Decide whether to engage in diplomacy or war.
- **Reinforce weak areas:** Allocate squads and generals where most needed.
- **Adapt to world events:** Adjust strategies based on anomalies, enemy invasions, or supply shortages.

### **3.2 General AI Tactical Logic**
- Uses **territory control algorithms** to determine strategic importance.
- **Reinforcement requests** when battles escalate beyond squad capabilities.
- **Analyzes enemy weaknesses** and deploys counter-strategies dynamically.

### **3.3 Squad Leader Behavior Tree**
1. **Check orders from General AI**
   - Attack
   - Defend
   - Patrol
   - Reinforce
2. **Evaluate Threats**
   - Scan enemy presence
   - Adjust formation and positioning
   - Request support if outnumbered
3. **Engage Combat**
   - Command squad members to take cover, flank, or retreat
   - Issue fire orders based on priority targets

### **3.4 Squad Member State Machine**
- **Idle:** Waiting for orders.
- **Moving:** Navigating to assigned position.
- **Engaging:** Firing at targets.
- **Taking Cover:** Moving to the closest safe location.
- **Reloading:** Preparing for another engagement.
- **Retreating:** Falling back when overwhelmed.

## **4. AI Interaction with Game Systems**

### **4.1 Diplomacy & Faction Relations**
- AI factions track historical interactions to determine aggression or cooperation.
- **Alliances form dynamically** based on common threats and trade benefits.
- Betrayals or ceasefires can occur based on shifting faction needs.

### **4.2 Economy & Resource Management**
- AI prioritizes **critical supply chains** (weapons, medical supplies, ammunition).
- **Market fluctuations** affect AI trade routes and faction income.
- AI reacts to **economic shortages** by seeking new suppliers or raiding enemy stockpiles.

### **4.3 Combat System Integration**
- AI evaluates **terrain advantages** for positioning.
- **Dynamic flanking maneuvers** implemented through tactical pathfinding.
- AI squads **adjust formations** based on enemy type and numbers.

### **4.4 Zone Events Reaction System**
- AI evaluates whether to **seek shelter** during blowouts and PSI emissions.
- Factions shift supply chains based on **mutant migrations** and enemy movement.
- **Zombies and Monolith-controlled areas** trigger new behavioral patterns.

---

## **5. AI Adaptability & Learning**
- AI factions **learn from battles** and adjust their strategies accordingly.
- Enemy factions may **mimic successful tactics** used against them.
- **Adaptive recruitment strategies**â€”losing factions will increase their recruitment rate to balance the game.

---

## **6. Future Considerations**
- Implement **neural network-based AI adjustments** for smarter decision-making.
- Enhance **real-time strategy AI for large-scale battles**.
- Introduce **difficulty scaling** based on player performance.
