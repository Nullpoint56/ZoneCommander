# **Technical Design Document (TDD) - ZoneCommander**

## **1. Introduction**
### **Purpose**
This document defines the technical architecture and implementation plan for ZoneCommander. It outlines the core components, frameworks, data structures, and performance considerations needed to develop the game efficiently.

### **Scope**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Architecture:** Modular, Object-Oriented
- **Core Features:** AI-driven faction simulation, real-time/turn-based hybrid mechanics, dynamic world events, and a strategic management layer.
- **Target Platforms:** PC (initially terminal-based, with potential for graphical UI expansion)

## **3. Core Components & Implementation Details**
### **3.1 Game Loop**
- Manages turn-based or real-time hybrid execution.
- Processes player inputs and AI actions.
- Updates game state and triggers events.

### **3.2 AI System**
- **Faction AI** → Manages diplomacy, economy, and expansion.
- **Generals AI** → Issues commands based on faction priorities.
- **Squad AI** → Executes objectives at a tactical level.
- **Individual AI** → Performs atomic behaviors based on orders.

### **3.3 Event System**
- Handles Zone anomalies, faction conflicts, and environmental changes.
- Uses a procedural event generator to create replayability.

### **3.4 Economy & Resources**
- Dynamic trading system with supply and demand fluctuations.
- Faction-based economic modifiers (e.g., Duty’s restriction to Ecologist trades).

### **3.5 UI & Interaction**
- **Phase 1:** Terminal-based interface.
- **Phase 2:** Potential graphical UI integration.

---

## **4. Data Persistence**
- **Save System:** JSON-based data storage.
- **Database:** SQLite for structured faction and event data.
- **Mod Support:** Planned for future releases.

---

## **5. Performance Considerations**
- Optimized AI decision-making to reduce CPU load.
- Efficient memory management for storing faction states.
- Asynchronous processing for UI responsiveness.

---

## **6. Development Timeline**
| Phase | Feature | Estimated Time |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | Core Mechanics (Faction AI, Squads, Events) | 2 months |
| Phase 2 | UI & Interaction Improvements | 1 month |
| Phase 3 | Optimization & Balancing | 1 month |
| Phase 4 | Multiplayer (if applicable) | TBD |

---

## **7. Future Considerations**
- Implementation of a graphical UI for better accessibility.
- Advanced AI interactions and diplomacy features.
- Potential multiplayer expansion for cooperative gameplay.
